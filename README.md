The following datasets have been provided as a starter kit to get started with the competition. Letâ€™s understand them briefly:
1. Global Power Plant Database by World Resources Institute(WRI)

The Global Power plant database is a fully open-sourced(licensed under CC-BY 4.0.) and a comprehensive database that includes details of powerplants around the world. The database covers approximately 30,000 power plants from 164 countries and includes both thermal and renewable power plants.
2. Sentinel 5P OFFL NO2

Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) is an Earth observation satellite developed by ESA as part of the Copernicus Programme. The Copernicus Programme is dedicated to monitoring air pollution and Sentinel 5P Precursor is its first mission. It consists of an instrument called Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) which is a spectrometer to monitor ozone, methane, formaldehyde, aerosol, carbon monoxide, NO2 and SO2 in the atmosphere.


The OFFL/NO2 is a dataset that provides offline high-resolution imagery of NO2 concentrations

3. Global Forecast System 384-Hour Predicted Atmosphere Data

Global Forecast System(GFS) is a model that forecasts weather.The GFS is a coupled model, composed of an atmosphere model, an ocean model, a land/soil model, and a sea ice model which work together to provide an accurate picture of weather conditions

4. GLDAS-2.1: Global Land Data Assimilation System

This dataset provided by NASA ingest satellite- and ground-based observational data products, using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques, in order to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes (Rodell et al., 2004a)
